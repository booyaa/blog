<p>I'm getting less and less satisfied with Twitter to exchange thoughts. The 140 characters is not the obvious problem, since you can chain messages easily. The issue is that those thoughts are ephemeral. This medium does not optimize for smart discussion with relevant people, but for quick wit from currently available people, before being dumped under a stack of comments on the latest news. The retweeting does not help much, since the primary reason for retweeting are 1. it's funny 2. it is shocking 3. it's inspiring, and long last "maybe it's interesting". They don't create much discussion.</p>
<p>Until now, I have primarily used this blog for long posts (thus explaining why I don't write much here). As my friends say "if it's more than 3 tweets, write a blog post".</p>
<p>So in the following months, I'll try to post short, not well researched but spontaneous articles, instead of ranting in 140 characters.</p>
