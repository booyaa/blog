<p>For this new year, I have no resolutions. Well, I have the usual "do a little workout", "don't get up so late", but I don't really have faith in these. Instead, I have a list of projects on which I'm working or I'm wanting to work. And I often have difficulties motivating myself.</p>
<p>My solution is: if you're interested in any of these ideas, come and poke me regularly, to remind me that I have to finish that project :)</p>
<p>Here are the projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package manager for Windows: my final year project at Centrale Lille (in progress)</li>
<li>Wix port on Linux: because some projects want to generate their installers on Linux, because some people don't want to use Mono, and because I like to play (started)</li>
<li>Open source sandboxing application for Windows (in progress)</li>
<li>MTP synchronization in VLC media player (in progress)</li>
<li>Crash report handling web interface for VLC media player (in progress)</li>
<li>Qt embedded interface for VLC (not started)</li>
<li>Complete the Windows 7 headers I've written for VLC and send then to MinGW (not started)</li>
<li>Contribute to VLMC (not started)</li>
<li>Add Minidump support in GDB: I need it (not started)</li>
<li>Generate .lib import libraries with ld or with some custom binary running on Linux (not started)</li>
<li>Scriptable web client in Python supporting Javascript with V8 bindings (not started)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these projects are maybe too ambitious but, you know, if you aim high, you fail higher than those who succeed :)</p>
<p>If you're interested in some of these projects and would like to discuss them with me, feel free to contact me!</p>
