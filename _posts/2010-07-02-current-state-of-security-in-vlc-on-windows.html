<p>A recent report from <a href="http://secunia.com/blog/105">Secunia</a> states that popular Windows applications don't use the DEP and ASLR protections. It is true for VLC up to 1.0: the latest version at the moment, 1.1, supports permanent DEP mode, and ASLR on all of its DLLs.</p>
<p>One thing the report could have shown is the difference between applicatins built with MSVC or GCC. Adding DEP and ASLR in Visual Studio means adding /NXCompat and DynamicBase to the compilation options. With MinGW, there is a <a href="http://eleves.ec-lille.fr/~couprieg/post/Enable-DEP-and-ASLR-on-your-applications-built-with-MinGW">different trick</a>. This article on my old blog is slightly outdated: ld in binutils 2.20 supports the --nxcompat and --dynamicbase options. So, now, the developers using GCC have no more excuse!</p>
<p>Let's sum up the state of the security of VLC:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.0.5 is NOT SAFE on Windows. 1.0.6 brings a lot of <a href="http://www.videolan.org/security/sa1003.html">security fixes</a>, but this version was not released on Windows. And security features are not used.</li>
<li>1.1.0 supports permanent DEP and ASLR (with DllCharacteristics flag, only on Vista/7) and termination on heap corruption</li>
<li>1.1.1 supports the same as 1.1.0, and adds DEP on XP SP3 with SetProcessDEPPolicy</li>
<li>SafeSEH and stack cookies are not yet used</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers using LibVLC should check their software: DEP won't be activated if their executable doesn't support it.</p>
