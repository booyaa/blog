<p>I just released <a title="Pilot SSH" href="http://pilotssh.com/?utm_source=link1&amp;utm_medium=unhandledexpression&amp;utm_campaign=announce" target="_blank">Pilot SSH</a>, a server administration application for iPhone. So, why another SSH application? Aren't there dozens of these already?</p>
<p>I tried a lot of those shell applications, and they felt clunky on a phone. They are fine with a tablet (even more if you use a bluetooth keyboard), but writing commands on a phone's keyboard is not really intuitive. Moreover, the small screen of a phone is not really usable to display the command results.</p>
<p>But I reaaaaally wanted to manage my servers from my phone. Because I am not always in front of my computer. Because I am too lazy to get the laptop from the bag, open it, plug the 3G key or find WiFi, connect over SSH and type a command to restart a crashed web server. Because it would be awesome to be in a bar and say "hold on, I have update my server", open my phone and do it in 3 touches.</p>
<p>So, here it is, Pilot SSH, in all its glory, can out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>display running processes, the memory they use, and kill them</li>
<li>show which websites are enabled or disabled in Apache</li>
<li>display the uptime, halt or reboot the server</li>
<li>show Apache logs</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-544" alt="Pilot SSH process list" src="/assets/process_list.png?w=200" width="200" height="300" /> Pilot SSH process list</p>
<p>But there is more! The application is completely extensible, because it uses scripts stored on the server side, in your home, in <strong>~/.pilotssh</strong>. You can totally replace the current scripts, download more from <a title="Pilot SSH scripts" href="https://github.com/Geal/PilotSSH-scripts" target="_blank">the Github repository</a>, and make your own! The scripts can be written in any language, as long as they return a JSON string conforming to the API.</p>
<p>I already got a contribution soon after the launch, with a script to flush the caches. And I have a lot of ideas for new scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>upgrade a Wordpress website</li>
<li>display the status of processes managed by Monit</li>
<li>create/remove users</li>
<li>Support nginx too</li>
<li>Display more logs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the beginning, and I expect a lot of impressive ideas from the users of Pilot SSH. I can't wait to see them!</p>
<p>Do you want to try Pilot SSH? Everything you need is on <a title="Pilot SSH" href="http://pilotssh.com/?utm_source=link2&amp;utm_medium=unhandledexpression&amp;utm_campaign=announce" target="_blank">its website</a>!</p>
