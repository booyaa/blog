<p>Hello, happy readers and indexing bots! Here is my brand new blog!</p>
<p><a title="my old blog" href="http://eleves.ec-lille.fr/~couprieg/" target="_blank">The old one</a> was getting messy, alterning french and english posts without any reason, and it had no purpose.</p>
<p>So, I present you with my new blog: a place for me to write about fun code, weird bugs, even weirder opinions, and to share a lot of bad puns.</p>
<p>I host it on <a title="Wordpress hosting" href="http://www.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>, so that its admins do all the boring work in my place. Thanks, guys!</p>
<p>I will copy my tutorials for VLC media player from my old blog to the <a title="VideoLAN wiki" href="http://wiki.videolan.org" target="_blank">VideoLAN wiki</a>, and the other posts still useful (if there are ones) will be posted here (dear Wordpress.com admins, could you add the Dotclear importing plugin here, please?).</p>
<p>That's it, have a good time reading this blog, and happy new year!</p>
