<p>Last week, I wrote <a title="5 easy tips to accelerate SSL" href="http://unhandledexpression.com/2013/01/25/5-easy-tips-to-accelerate-ssl/" target="_blank">a post about SSL optimization</a> that showed the big interest people have in getting the absolute best performance from their web servers.</p>
<p>That post was just a small part of <a title="SSL: what you need to know" href="http://leanpub.com/SSL" target="_blank">the ebook on SSL tuning</a> I am currently writing. This ebook will cover various subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>algorithms comparison</li>
<li>handshake tuning</li>
<li>HSTS</li>
<li>session tickets</li>
<li>load balancers</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>I test a lot of different architectures, to provide you with tips directly adaptable to your system (like I did previously with Apache and Nginx). But I don't have access to every system under the sun...</p>
<p>So, if you feel adventurous enough to try SSL optimization on your servers, <a href="http://geoffroycouprie.com/" target="_blank">please contact me</a>, I would be happy to help you!</p>
<p>I am especially interested in large architectures (servers in multiple datacenters around the world, large load balancers, CDNs) and mobile application backends.</p>
<p>And don't forget to <a title="SSL: what you need to know" href="http://leanpub.com/SSL" target="_blank">check out the ebook, to be notified about updates!</a></p>
