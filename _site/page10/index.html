        Smalltalk
      
    
  </span>
</div>

    
      <p>For more than a year, I have been playing with Smalltalk, and more specifically the <a title="Pharo, an open source Smalltalk" href="http://pharo-project.org" target="_blank">Pharo project</a>, and I had a lot of fun! Now, I'd like to share this experience. I saw a lot of introductions to Smalltalk, but they were all about its amazing features from a CS point of vue. I'm a software engineer, so I'll give you a more pragmatic look, with a few useful tips.</p>
<p>When you hear about Smalltalk, you imagine old bearded guys, clinging to their outdated language. In reality, this is what I saw: a small yet growing community full of nice and motivated people, enjoying development and innovating everyday. Even if the language is old, they're keeping it up to date with today's standards: JIT compiling, web development, iPhone port... I strongly encourage you to take a look and, maybe, participate!</p>
<h2>First look: the interface</h2>
<p>The first impression is the most shocking: you don't understand what you can/should do with that empty window. It is not the code editor you would expect. It is an entire world, full of living objects. The behaviour of these objects is described by code, but they're not programs with a beginning and an end. For a good impression of that, try closing the environment (don't forget to save) and starting it again: your windows are still open, exactly in the same place! Even selected text is still there! Your object's life doesn't end when you close the environment: they're serialized in the image file.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-164" title="pharo-firstscreen" src="/assets/pharo-firstscreen.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="205" /></p>
<p>The environment is composed of a virtual machine executing the code, an image file containing the objects, and a source file, storing a part of the source code. And that's all. No files.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>the <a href="http://smalltalk.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Smalltalk</a> environment uses files to store source code.</p>
<p>In the previous picture, you will see the code browser, used for everyday development. It doesn't display files, but (from left to right) categories, classes, method categories, methods, and under that, the actual code for the method. The code editor is organized around the actual structure of the code, not some arbitrary folder tree. It can be confusing at first, but it's actually quite elegant. There's a drawback though: you can't use your favorite code editor to write Smalltalk code. Another nice side effect of the image: I store my environment on a USB key, and can use it to work seamlessly on Windows, Mac and Linux (using the <a title="Download the one click pharo image" href="http://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/28015/Pharo-1.1.1-OneClick.zip">one click pharo image</a>).</p>
<h2>Second look: the language</h2>
<p>The language itself is another surprise: what are those ifTrue and whileTrue? You can't think that Smalltalk has a syntax used for control flow.  In Smalltalk, everything is an object. And the primary way of interacting with an object is sending it a message. The whole syntax of Smalltalk revolves around messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>"1+2/3" is not equal to 5/3, but to 1, because you send to 1 the message "+" with argument 2, which gives you 3, and you send this result the message "/" with argument 3.</li>
<li>ifTrue is a message sent to a boolean, with a "block" as argument (a block is a piece of code). The block will be executed if the boolean is an instance of True.</li>
<li>you can't access directly the members of an object: you need to create messages to read and modify these members.</li>
</ul>
<p>The methods are separated between the class side and the instance side. The classes are objects, so they have their own methods (think of it as static methods). They're used for a lot of things, like generating common instances (String crlf, Color blue, etc), or starting servers.</p>
<p>If you take a good look at a class like string, you will spot apparently redundant methods like displayOn:, displayOn:at:, displayAt:, displayOn:at:textColor:. They're not redundant: displayOn calls displayOn:at:, which calls displayOn:at:textColor:. This is actually very elegant, because it keeps methods small and readable.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind when you're developing in Smalltalk: readability is more important that speed, because the time you gain now will be wasted the next time you try to read your code.</p>
<h2>Next: the tools</h2>
<p>You saw the code browser, but there are other nice tools designed to help you every day.</p>
<p>Monticello is a distributed versioning system integrated in the environment. Nothing special here: it tracks your changes, create revisions, and supports local (folders) and remote (HTTP, FTP) repositories.</p>
<p>There is a test runner that displays all the tests loaded in your environment. You will see that there is a very good coverage, but it is not enough! Contribute a test or two if you have time.</p>
<p>Last but not least: the refactoring browser. It is an amazing piece of code which analyzes your classes, points out design mistakes, and in some cases, can correct them in your place.</p>
<h2>OK, now, what can I develop?</h2>
<p>You can do about anything in Smalltalk, like other languages: desktop applications, web applications, use databases, network protocols, REST APIs... It is particularly suited for big applications with complex object models.</p>
<p>For desktop applications, you will easily have cross platform code and UI, but you won't be able to use native windows (at least, not with Squeak or Pharo). For web applications, you can choose between these frameworks: <a href="http://www.seaside.st">Seaside</a>, <a href="http://www.iliadproject.org">Iliad</a> and <a href="http://www.aidaweb.si/">Aida</a>. Each one has a different philosophy, and different strengths, so try them all out!</p>
<p>Developing in Smalltalk has been an amazing experience: I learned a lot, and the concepts and habits I took are easily applied to other languages. now, I just need a way to work in Smalltalk for my day job :)</p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;">Yesterday was introduced the<a title="The Facebook blog" href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=452288242130" target="_blank"> new Facebook Messages interface</a>. Huzzah! You get an @facebook.com email address, unification of IM and email, conversation history, etc. That sounds cool! And what is that new feature called "social inbox"? That's nice, messages from your friends will be prioritized and appear directly in your inbox, and other emails will go to the "others" box. Wait, what?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This feature is meant to help you <del>waste time</del> connect efficiently with your network. I won't go into the analysis of how your email contacts are not always friends, even the important and regular ones, how will Google react, or how will we send emails with no subject line. I'm sure someone will talk about that at length. Instead, let's talk about these nice people always interested in becoming our friends, sell us cheap software enlarge our <del>pe</del> bank account: spammers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the old world of regular email (yes, old, we're in Web 2.0, Gmail is soooo last week), we had spam filters. <a title="WP: Antispam techniques" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques" target="_blank">A lot of methods</a> were developed to protect us: blacklistingm whitelisting, greylisting, bayesian filters, SMTP verification, CAPTCHAs, etc. They're not all efficient, but services like Gmail are really good at catching unwanted email. Spamming is an activity with a very low conversion rate: you have to send thousands of emails just to get one gullible person to click and buy. Thankfully, emails are cheap to send. But we could improve that conversion rate. Facebook just did it.</p>
<blockquote><p>With new Messages, your Inbox will only contain messages from your friends and their friends. All other messages will go into an Other folder where you can look at them separately.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Put you in situation. A gorgeous woman/man/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you're_a_dog" target="_blank">dog</a> wants to be your friend on Facebook. Will you accept her/him? Let's say she has more or less the same tastes has you (that's surprinsingly easy to get the list of a band's fans, same for book, political views, etc). Not yet? Let's say you have friends more gullible than you. The hot woman is a friend of another friend and sends you a message in these terms: "Hi! We met at &lt;gullible friend&gt;'s party a few months ago, I had a really good time talking to you". You just accepted the friend request, admit it. And a few days/weeks later, she will begin sending you messages about great opportunities like ponzi schemes or nigerian scams. And YOU WILL CLICK! Because it will appear directly in your inbox. Because it comes from one of your friends, someone you more or less trust.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Facebook just gave spammers a direct access to your inbox, and offered them targeted advertising, thanks to all the groups, likes, music and book fan groups. Spammers are considered dumb, because they automate a lot. But thanks to Facebook's social features, they will learn to customize the mails, just for you. They will pay cheap workers to talk to you through the fake accounts, they will get you, your friends and your family, and will be a part of your great friends network.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thanks to Facebook.</p>

<p>Look! <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/513190">A new</a> <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/research/tech-reports/2010/CSE-2010-2.pdf">shiny</a> <a href="http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/08/exploiting-dll-hijacking-flaws.html">vulnerability</a>, affecting a lot of Windows applications!

<p>&lt;/crazy mode off&gt;</p>
<p>OK, let's get serious. This vulnerability is actually <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1699/discuss">a very old one</a>. It is there because the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586(v=VS.85).aspx">DLL search order</a> includes the current directory (if someone can tell me why, I would be delighted to know that). Here is the search order (source: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586(v=VS.85).aspx">MSDN</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>If <strong>SafeDllSearchMode</strong> is enabled, the search order is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The directory from which the application loaded.</li>
<li>The system directory. Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724373(v=VS.85).aspx"><strong>GetSystemDirectory</strong></a> function to get the path of this directory.</li>
<li>The 16-bit system directory. There is no function that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched.</li>
<li>The Windows directory. Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724454(v=VS.85).aspx"><strong>GetWindowsDirectory</strong></a> function to get the path of this directory.</li>
<li>The current directory.</li>
<li>The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable. Note that this does not include the per-application path specified by the <strong>App Paths</strong> registry key. The <strong>App Paths</strong> key is not used when computing the DLL search path.</li>
</ol>
<p>If <strong>SafeDllSearchMode</strong> is disabled, the search order is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The directory from which the application loaded.</li>

<p>For the record: disabling SafeDllSearchMode means that you're stupid, or that you're using a Windows before XP SP1 (note that this is not exclusive).</p>
<p>So, let's assume that your application tries to load a DLL that isn't present, either in your application directory, or in the system directories. Then, the application will try to load the DLL from the current directory. And that's it. If there's a DLL with the same name in that folder, it will be loaded in the application. That's why you can get owned by opening a file in that same directory: it sets the current directory of the application to the file's folder.</p>
<p>OMG OMG OMG we're DOOMED, and it's incredibly easy to exploit me!</p>
<p>So, now, let's take a look at the fix. This is an OS flaw. You can't fix all your applications yourself. H.D. Moore has some <a href="http://blog.rapid7.com/?p=5325">sysadmin fixes</a> that you can apply to prevent the exploit from coming on your computer. But your applications will still be exploitable.</p>
<p>If you're a developer, though, you can fix your application. There's a function that can remove the current directory from the DLL search path: SetDllDirectory. From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686203(VS.85).aspx">MSDN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After calling <strong>SetDllDirectory</strong>, the DLL search path is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The directory from which the application loaded.</li>
<li>The directory specified by the <em>lpPathName</em> parameter.</li>
<li>The system directory. Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724373(v=VS.85).aspx"><strong>GetSystemDirectory</strong></a> function to get the path of this directory. The name of this directory is System32.</li>
<li>The 16-bit system directory. There is no function that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched. The name of this directory is System.</li>
<li>The Windows directory. Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724454(v=VS.85).aspx"><strong>GetWindowsDirectory</strong></a> function to get the path of this directory.</li>
<li>The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you pass a safe directory(let's say, C:\Windows\System32, or your application directory) as argument to SetDllDirectory, you effectively remove the current directory from the search path! It works, I tested it for you :)</p>
<p>But that's not the end: you have to wipe out the PATH to be safe. <a href="http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/08/exploiting-dll-hijacking-flaws.html">From the metasploit blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the application is trying to load a DLL that is normally found within the PATH, but not the Windows system directories, and the PATH contains environment variables that have not been set, then the literal value of the environment variable will be treated as sub-directory of the working directory (the share). For example, if %unknownvariable%\bin is in the system PATH, the share will be searched for a directory called “%unknownvariable%\bin” and the target DLL will be loaded from within this sub-directory.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if you test  your application with ProcMon, you will surely see that a lot of (potentially unsafe) directories are added to the PATH, and used to look for the DLL. So, remove all the useless directories from the PATH if you can!</p>
<p>(And now, for the disclaimer: this blog post is not endorsed by Microsoft, and if you want to be really safe and know the best solution to employ, wait for Microsoft's patches and workarounds. But if you trust me enough (you fool... *evil laugh*), you can try that fix on your application, and maybe protect your users. )</p>
<p>Actually, that fix is encouraged by Microsoft, and David Leblanc wrote about it in February 2008.</p>

      <p>VLC 1.1.1 was <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/releases/1.1.1.html">just released</a>! A lot of bugs were fixed, and now, GPU decoding works on ATI cards! You need Catalyst 10.7 to use DxVA on your ATI GPU.</p>
<p>Other important news: libVLC has a lot of new useful functions, like libvlc_set_user_agent(), or libvlc_video_set_callbacks() and libvlc_video_set_format() to replace the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/lounge/24239/">--vmem-* hack</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy this new release!</p>
