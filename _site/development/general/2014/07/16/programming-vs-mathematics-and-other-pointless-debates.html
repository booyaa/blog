    <p>I do not know who started this argument a few days ago. It feels like something coming from HN. Do you need to know mathematics to be a good programmer?</p>
<p>There is a lot of differing opinions. Maybe programming is a subbranch of mathematics, or programming is using mathematics. Or learning programming is closer to learning a new language. For me, saying that programming is about languages is like saying that literature is about languages. Sure, you need words to indicate concepts, some languages are better suited than others for that, and some concepts are better expressed in other languages. It is more like a hierarchy to me: philosophy formalizes concepts used by authors to write in common languages. Mathematics formalize concepts used by programmers to create code in common languages.<br />
But this is besides the point.</p>
<p>This debate sparks outrage, since it touches a central point of our education, and one that is often not taught very well. "Look, I do not use geometry while writing a loop, so maths are pointless for me". A lot of developers will never learn basic algebra or logic and will never need it in their day job. And that's okay.<br />
Programming is not a single profession anymore. Each and every one of us has a different definition. A mechanical engineer working on bridges, another on metallic parts for cars and another one on plastic toys all have different needs, different techniques for their job, although the fundamental basis (evaluating breaking strength, time of assembly, production costs) is the same. That does not make one of these jobs worth more than the other.</p>
<p>The real problem is that we are still fighting among ourselves to define what our job is. The other pointless debate, about software being engineering, science or craft, is evidence of that. And it will stay hard to define for a long time.<br />
We are in a unique position. Usually, when a new field emerges, either tinkerers are launching it and later, good practices are studied to make it engineering, or scientists create it, then means of production become cheaper and crafters take over.<br />
Computers were started by scientists, but the ease of access gave crafters a good opportunity to take over. But that does not mean research stopped when people started coding at home. So now, in a relatively new field (less than a century), while we are still exploring, we have a very large spectrum of jobs and approaches, from the most scientific to the most artistic kind. And that is okay. More world views will help us get better at our respective jobs.</p>
<p>So, while you are arguing that the other side is misguided, irrealistic or unrigorous, take time to consider where they come from. They do not have the same job, and that job can seem pointless to you, but they can be good at it, so there is probably something good you can learn from their approach. The only thing you should not forgive from the other side is the lack of curiosity.</p>
